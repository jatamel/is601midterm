For this assignment, I attempted to create a calculator that utilizes higher level programming practices and techniques. I was able to impliment a REPL that accepts user input. I attempted to integrate a plugin system.. There is a logging system that tracks the imput and interactions the user makes with the program. Throughout this assignment there are some obstacles I have faced, some of which I some I ultimately could not overcome. I hope to build upon what little knowledge I've retained thus far.
